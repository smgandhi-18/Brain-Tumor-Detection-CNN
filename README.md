## Introduction
This project is focused on the detection of brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain that can be benign or malignant. Early detection of brain tumors is crucial for treatment and improving patient outcomes. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to automate the classification of brain MRI images into categories: "no tumor" and "tumor". The aim is to build a robust model that can assist radiologists in diagnosing brain tumors more effectively.

## Installation
To get started with this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine along with several libraries.

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection

Dependencies:
TensorFlow
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Make sure you have a CUDA-compatible GPU if you intend to train the model on GPU.
